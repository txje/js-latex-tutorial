LaTeX Tutorial in Javascript
----------------------------

Requirements (included):
- texlive.js (https://github.com/manuels/texlive.js/)
- pdf.js (https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/)

I didn't really do much, just built a simple editing and display platform which compiles tex code
using texlive.js and pipes the output to display in pdf.js.

The result is a LaTeX tutorial for beginners without having to get an entire class to install
and run pdflatex.
